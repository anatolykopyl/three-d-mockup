# Three D Mockup

ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

This project is an evolution of the [vue-three-d-mockup](https://github.com/anatolykopyl/vue-three-d-mockup) component.
It aims to be more lightweight, and more portable.
This project builds to a native web component, that is framework agnostic or can be used without a framework at all.
